# Accel-Sim Insights and Exploration

This repository contains my notes, code snippets, and insights gained while exploring the internals of [Accel-Sim](https://github.com/accel-sim/accel-sim-framework), a detailed simulator for modern GPU architectures. The goal is to deepen understanding of GPU microarchitecture behavior, simulation flow, and performance modeling.
